### EUNet
- This is a project to post political content
- At first, this content will be mostly related to my opinions
- This is mostly focused on the EU

## Pages
 - A blog post page: This will be the main page
 - A contact page: Will need to be heavily filtered
 - Later, a way to seperate the content will be needed

## Backend
 - Will need a backend for this to host pages on
 - Will eventually add users

## Idea
Once the initial idea of posting my own beliefs is met, I'll add a user system so that people can comment/like posts. Later, I will add a way for users to post their own content. This will be on seperate, modded boards. I will get to chose what goes where on the website.

The backend will be hosted on a nodejs server. I also need to find a good domain provider to post my political content, and find a backend hosting service which isn't too expensive.

## Visuals
Most of the page will be EU-blue.
